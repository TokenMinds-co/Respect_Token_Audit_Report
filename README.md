# This Repository contains the Audit report for the Respect token done by Tokenminds. 

TokenMinds conducted a comprehensive four-level testing process for smart contracts, structured in a pyramid approach. 

The process began with a meticulous manual review of the smart contract, ensuring that the code follows best practices and is free from apparent errors. 

It was followed by functional testing, where the contract's behavior was thoroughly checked to confirm that it performs its intended functions accurately.

Next, the smart contract underwent rigorous security testing, identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited. 

Finally, TokenMinds concluded the process with fuzz testing, which stress-tests the core functionalities by inputting random or unexpected data to ensure stability and robustness under diverse conditions.
